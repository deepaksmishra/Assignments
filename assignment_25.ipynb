    "1)What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "Ans: A List Comprehension, just like the plain range function, executes immediately and returns a list.\n",

    "    is enclosed in square brackets [] while the Generator expression is enclosed in plain parentheses ().\n"

    "Ans: \n",

    "3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "Ans: Python provides a generator to create your own iterator function. A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values.\n",
    "In a generator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement.\n"

    "Ans:The yield statement suspends the function's execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable the function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, \n",
    "    the function continues the execution immediately after the last yield run.\n",

    "Ans: List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\n",
    "    List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required)\n",
